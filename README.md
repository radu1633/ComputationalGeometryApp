This app is composed of algorithms belonging to geometry. The implemented algorithms are: 

-the localization of point inside or outside of a triangle,
localization of a point in a simple polygon,
slab method in a graph,
chain method in a graph,
binary tree method,
jarvis,
graham.

The data needed by some algorithms is stored in files.
